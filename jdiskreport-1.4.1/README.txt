                    JDiskReport(tm) Version 1.4.1
                 A Free Graphical Disk Report Utility


INTRODUCTION

     JDiskReport enables you to understand how much space 
     the directories and files consume on your disk drives and 
     it can help you find large, old and obsolete files and folders.

     Therefore it analyzes your disk drives and collects statistics 
     that you can view as overview charts and details tables.
     
     JDiskReport 1.4.1 requires Java 6 or later. At least 64 MB
     of physical RAM is recommended to run JDiskReport. 
     
     

INSTALLING AND RUNNING THE WINDOWS EDITION

     Make sure you have Java installed *before* you install JDiskReport.
     You can download Java from www.java.com. 

     To install, run the installer file
         jdiskreport-1_4_1-win.exe
     and follow the setup instructions.

     You can invoke JDiskReport from the 'Start > Programs' menu or 
     from the Explorer's popup menu for a selected folder.



INSTALLING AND RUNNING THE JAVA EDITION

     The Java-enabled edition comes as a ZIP archive that contains:
       o LICENSE.txt           - the license agreement
       o README.txt            - this readme file
       o RELEASE-NOTES.txt     - information about changes and bug fixes
       o jdiskreport-1.4.1.jar - a signed executable JAR file

     Extract the files from the ZIP archive; do not extract files from 
     the JAR. Then run JDiskReport and follow the setup instructions.

     To run JDiskReport from a command-line, change directory to
     where the JAR-file is located. Then execute:
        java -jar jdiskreport-1.4.1.jar

     On most platforms you can launch JDiskReport by using a 
     platform-specific mechanism to launch the executable JAR file.
     For example, on Windows you can double-click the JAR.
