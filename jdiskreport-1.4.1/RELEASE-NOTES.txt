INTRODUCTION

  This maintenance update comes with a slightly polished main window
  and behaves better on Windows Vista.
  
  Previous versions created a folder ".jdiskreport" in the user home
  directory, which was rarely used by Windows users. On Windows Vista
  the "Users\<user name>\" directory is visited more frequently, and
  a ".jdiskreport" directory may annoy users.   
  The JDiskReport folder is now created under the %APPDATA% directory,
  if available, otherwise under the user home directory - as before.
