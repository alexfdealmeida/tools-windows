Thank you for purchasing Search and Replace!

PLEASE NOTE: While Search and Replace allows replacing in binary
files (such as .DOC, .XLS etc), these proprietary format files may
contain internal counters which may get out of synch.  As a result,
the application that created the file may not be able to read it.
For best results, replace in ASCII text files (such as .HTM, .RTF,
.TXT, .INI, .C, .CPP, .H etc).  In particular, Word files should be
converted to RTF format which can be safely processed.  For
replacing in shortcuts or the registry, see our new utilities at
http://www.funduc.com.  For Word file replacement, see the WordSR
freeware on our website.

  characters. 
- The Windows 95/NT version allows View Context of binary files 
  through a new Freeware utility: HexView.  HexView can be 
  downloaded from http://www.funduc.com.  It should then be 
  installed in the same directory as Search and Replace(or in the 
  path or the Windows dir.). 
- Scripts can be created to specify multiple search/replace 
  combinations (with associated settings) and/or multiple paths and 
  masks to process.  The script settings (masks, paths, 
  search/replace strings) can also be overridden from the main 
  screen. 
- Exclude masks can now be used.  For example: 
  *.*;~*.swp;~*.exe;~*.dll will process all but *.swp;*.exe;*.dll 
  files. 

Features planned for future releases include:
- Quiet mode when using the user interface (no read-only or error 
  prompts).
- Additional variables for file date/time and system date/time to
  be used in searches/replaces

Directory Toolkit for Windows 95/NT (shareware) - A multipurpose
directory comparison and file manager that provides features missing
from Windows 95/98 and Windows NT 4.0 or higher.  It displays single
directory lists or side-by-side directory comparisons using color
coding for alike, different, or missing files.  Comparisons can be
based on dates or a binary file analysis of file content.  You can
copy, move, & rename files while retaining long filenames and six
built-in synchronize functions simplify updating directories.
Built-in archive functions, with Explorer shell extensions, let you
create & manage archives from Explorer and use Directory Toolkit as
your primary archive manager for supported archives (ZIP, TAR, &
GZ).  File operations and directory comparison functions work
seamlessly on files in archives, e.g., no need to manually extract
files first.  Other features include statistics for file counts and
path sizes; Ignoring filename case during comparisons; Explorer
compatible OLE drag n Drop; Split/Concatenate files to/from
diskettes; Encode/Decode UENCODE, Base64(Mime), BinHex(Mac), and
XXENCODE formats (Decode also includes printable, 7 bit unencoded, &
plain text); An integrated comparison viewer for a color coded
display of the actual differences in files; Safe physical sort of
directories; Touch files (change time/date & attributes stamps);

Multiple include/exclude file masks and the ability to
include/exclude files based on size and date; Command line switches
to automate comparisons & synchronize operations via batch files;
Configurable output file and print functions to create reports of
single and comparison directory lists; Detects & runs (optionally)
setup programs in archives; File numbering to number files
sequentially based on adjustable sort order and a user defined
starting value.  Help file with examples included.  A complete
German version and Japanese language module are available from
http://www.funduc.com.  Cost: $25

Registry Toolkit (shareware) - Registry Toolkit is a utility for 
advanced computer users that performs search &/or replacement 
operations on the Windows 95/98/NT registry. You can 
search/replace using case sensitive or insensitive settings and
regular expressions in registry data, values, keys (or any 
combination) and specify the types of data to process. If you 
cancel a search the results up to that point (if any) are 
displayed in a tree list. You can print and print preview the
search results, import or export parts of the registry to/from
text files, create and edit keys, values, & data of all types, 
delete keys & values (after confirmation), and undo the last 
changes made. Registry Toolkit will operate on a remote 
registry (if you have permission to do so).  Cost: $25

Shortcut Doctor for Windows 95/NT (shareware) - Shortcut Doctor
allows you to check all your links/shortcuts and see which contain
targets which can no longer be found.  You can then delete the
shortcuts, resolve them or replace all shortcuts pointing to a
certain drive or directory with another (after validation of new
path is made). Individual shortcuts can be edited and all shortcuts
on a drive can be displayed, regardless of whether they are valid or
not.  CD-ROM drives or network drives can be ignored during
processing. Cost: $15.

Funduc Explorer Extensions (shareware) - Explorer Extensions allow
you to perform additional tasks using a familiar interface: the
Windows 95/NT Explorer.  You can split and concatenate files to/from
diskettes; Encode/Decode UUENCODE, Base64(Mime), BinHex(Mac), and
XXENCODE formats (Decode also includes printable, 7 bit unencoded, &
plain text), Touch files (change time/date stamp as well as
attributes). Cost: $15.

Drive Bar (shareware) - Drive Bar allows you to conveniently 
open views of your drives in Windows Explorer. Drive Bar's Auto 
Hide function allows it to disappear from view when not in use so 
that it does not take up screen space when not in use. You can 
resize Drive Bar and have it remain visible at all times if you 
like. You can also specify a File Manager program to use instead 
of Windows Explorer, launch drive views as "Tiled" or not, not 
include specified drives in the list of drive icons, and have 
Drive Bar run automatically at Windows startup (see Options). 
Cost: $10.

Sort and Slice (shareware) - Sort and Slice allows easy sorting 
and/or reformatting of Column Delimited files.The program can 
skip header lines, use regular expressions to process variable 
data and has a User Interface that allows the user to graphically 
determine the correct processing parameters. You can also remove 
repeat lines from files and pad fields during the sort. Command 
line switches and scripts are available to easily manage frequent 
operations. Cost: $25.

Delivery Agent (shareware) - Delivery Agent is a send-only email 
program for use by web site managers and network administrators. 
It allows you to easily deliver frequently used email messages 
(& attachments) as text files, which can then be sent to one or 
more users by simply selecting a message and entering the users' 
addresses or by providing a file that contains a list of addresses. 
The settings & message files may be managed with a text editor 
if you like and the program can keep a log of message activity. 
The program uses SMTP services for message delivery and does a 
POP check prior to sends for servers that require IP address 
verification before relaying is permitted. Cost: $25.

HexView for Windows 95/NT (freeware) -  HexView allows you to view,
print, print preview of any file as a Hex Dump.  HexView is
intended as a free companion program to our utility, Search and
Replace. However, it is a standalone application and you are free
to use it as you see fit.  The source code (C++ using MFC 4.x or
higher) can be downloaded for free from http://www.funduc.com. 

INI to Registry for Windows 95/NT (freeware) - This program works 
well with any program that relies on .ini files.  It can read the 
contents of any INI file and load them into the Windows 95/NT 
registry.  That way programs which previously used INI files can 
read the old data from the registry.  The program is free.  The 
source code is available for 25.  Please E-MAIL info@funduc.com for 
information on purchasing the source code. 

Decode Windows 95 Shell Extension (freeware) - This Explorer 
extension provides a subset of the decoding features available in 
Directory Toolkit.  It allows you to decode a UUENCODED, XXENCODED, 
BinHex or Base64(MIME) file by simply right-clicking on it in the 
Explorer and selecting Decode from the menu.  It supports multiple 
attachments, multi-part files (already concatenated), XXENCODED and 
User (table) encoded files in addition to UUENCODED, Base64(MIME) 
and BinHex (Mac format) files.

Count Characters (freeware) - This little app was written to: a)
Allow users to dump the contents of combo, edit and list boxes as
well as static and button fields to the clipboard.  This can come in
handy for browser lists, as well as items displayed by other
applications to which you otherwise have no access.  b) To help
users understand how applications are built (what types of controls
are used).  Other tools are available for this of course but they
are usually known only to programmers.  c) To allow users to know at
any time how many characters they have typed in an edit box.  This
might be useful, for example, if a site asks you to only enter a
certain amount of data in their fields but don't tell you that you
went over until it's too late.  Depending on the editor, html
authors might also find this handy for double checking the length of
meta tags.  Separate Win3x & Win 95/98/NT versions included.

Limit Edit (freeware) - Expands upon the built-in limit feature 
for edit boxes and rich edit controls by letting you set your 
own maximum size settings for the amount of text permitted in edit 
boxes and rich edit controls.  For example, you could use Limit 
Edit to set a limit on the amount of text allowed in an instance of 
the Notepad text editor.  Separate Win3x & Win 95/98/NT versions 
included.

Patch Creator (shareware) - Created for software authors, this 
program is used to make patches for updating registered versions 
software. Both the patch creator and patch applicator are easy to 
use GUI programs. The creator is a Win 95/98/NT utility. It can 
create either 16 or 32 bit patches that are self-contained in a 
single GUI .EXE. Compression can be used to reduce file size. You 
can require passwords (or not). Files on users' machines can be 
updated from a specific version, added regardless of existing 
version, removed or renamed. Cost: $75.

Decode/Encode DLLs (shareware) - Also a developer tool, the 
Decode/Encode DLLs can be called from any Windows programming 
language (such as VB, Visual C, Powerbuilder, etc.).  It allows 
you to automatically detect if a given file is UUENCODED, 
Base64(MIME), XXENCODED, BinHex or encoded with a user-supplied 
table.  The DLL can then decode the file(s) either in the current 
directory or in one specified by the user. Binary files can also be 
encoded for transmission over the Internet.  Cost: $58.

Custom programming and consulting services are also available.
